# Using four different plots for different economics scenarios
1. Top left:
- Strong preference for good 1
- Uses Cobb-Douglas with $\alpha=0.8, \beta=0.2$
- Shows indifference curves skewed toward good 1
- Represents a consumer who strongly prefers good 1 over good 2

2. Top right:
- Nearly perfect complements
- Uses CES with very negative $\pho$
- Shows nearly L-shaped curves
- Represents goods that must be consumed together (like left and right shoes)

3. Bottom left - Perfect Substitutes
- Shows straight line indifference curves
- Represents goods that can perfectly replace each other (like different brands of the same product)

4. Bottom right - Stone Geary Utility
- Multiple indifference curves (dashed lines)
- A budget constraint (red line)
- Clear labels and titles
- A grid for easier reading
